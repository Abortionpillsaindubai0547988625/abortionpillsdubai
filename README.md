 1) Every woman has the right to manage her own life. We believe that you know your needs and that you can make your own decisions about your life, your situation, and your future. The World Health Organization (WHO) has listed #mifepristone, misoprostol and the #abortion pill on its list of essential #medicines available everywhere that can be safely used at home during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. This causes a process very similar to a spontaneous abortion and, when used correctly, is 98% effective in terminating a pregnancy.

Abortion is a complex and sensitive topic. It’s a medical procedure that ends a pregnancy, and it can be a difficult decision for individuals and families. If you or someone you know is considering abortion, it’s essential to seek professional medical advice and support. Abortion pills UAE

There are different types of abortion, including:

1. Medical abortion (with pills)

2. Surgical abortion (in-clinic procedure)

 

Abortion is a legal right in many countries, but laws and restrictions vary widely. It’s crucial to understand local regulations and access reliable healthcare services. #Abortion pills UAE

Remember, I’m Gynaecologist, FDA medical professional. If you have any further questions or concerns, please consult On Whats app Chat for confidential and non-judgemental guidance. #Abortion pills UAE

Abortion pills refer to medications used to terminate a pregnancy. The two main types are:

1. Mifepristone (blocks progesterone, ending pregnancy)

2. Misoprostol (causes uterine contractions, expelling the pregnancy)

These pills are typically used in combination, with mifepristone taken first, followed by misoprostol 24-48 hours later. This method is commonly used for early pregnancies (up to 10 weeks).

It’s essential to note that:

– Abortion pills should only be used under medical supervision

– They are not effective for ectopic pregnancies

– Follow-up care is crucial to ensure a safe and complete abortion

I understand that you are seeking information about abortion pills in Dubai. Please note that abortion laws and availability of abortion pills vary by country and region. In Dubai, abortion is only legal in specific circumstances, such as when the pregnancy poses a risk to the mother’s life or in cases of fetal anomalies.

If you are seeking information on abortion services or pills in Dubai, I recommend consulting a qualified medical professional or a trusted healthcare provider. They can provide you with accurate and confidential guidance on available options and legal requirements. Abortion pills UAE

Additionally, you may want to consider reaching out to organisations such as:

– Dubai Health Authority (DHA)

– World Health Organisation (WHO) – Eastern Mediterranean Region

– Marie Stopes International (MSI) – UAE

A comprehensive guide for abortion would include:

1. Understanding Abortion: Definition, types (medical/surgical), and reasons for considering abortion.

2. Pregnancy Options: Parenting, adoption, and abortion.

3. Abortion Procedures: Medical abortion (pill), surgical abortion (in-clinic), and what to expect.

4. Eligibility and Timing: Gestational limits, health considerations, and when abortion is allowed.

5. Pre-Abortion Care: Counselling, consent, and medical preparation.

6. Post-Abortion Care: Follow-up, recovery, and emotional support.

7. Legal and Ethical Considerations: Laws, rights, and ethical dilemmas.

8. Accessing Abortion Services: Finding providers, costs, and financial assistance.

9. Emotional Support: Coping with feelings, support networks, and resources.

10. Follow-Up and Future Care: Contraception, reproductive health, and well-being.

Abortion is illegal in the UAE, with a few exceptions . The law allows abortions to be performed if the pregnancy is less than 120 days old and if the fetus has abnormalities, or if the pregnancy poses a threat to the mother’s life . In the first case, the consent of the husband is required, and in the second case, the consent of the husband is not required if the mother’s life is in critical danger

An unwanted pregnancy can be a difficult and stressful experience. If you or someone you know is facing an unplanned pregnancy, it’s essential to seek support and guidance from a trusted healthcare provider, counsellor, or support group.However, I can tell you that abortion laws in Dubai are strict, resulting in limited access to the necessary healthcare services for women in need ¹. You may be able to find more information on abortion clinics in Dubai from sites like Medium. Abortion laws and availability of services can be complex and vary by region. For more information, you may want to try searching online or contacting a trusted healthcare provider or organization that provides reproductive health services. Abortion pills UAE

Some options to consider include:

1. Parenting: Raising the child as your own.

2. Adoption: Placing the child with a loving family.

3. Abortion: Terminating the pregnancy (subject to local laws and regulations).

4. Prenatal care: Ensuring a healthy pregnancy and birth, regardless of the decision.

Remember, it’s crucial to prioritise emotional and physical well-being during this challenging time. Don’t hesitate to reach out for help and support.

Resources:

– Healthcare providers (OB-GYNs, primary care physicians)

– Counsellors (therapists, social workers)

– Support groups (local organisations, online forums)

– Helplines (e.g., Planned Parenthood, National Suicide Prevention Lifeline)

PERFORMING A MEDICAL #Abortion USING MISOPROSTOL (#cytotec 200 mcg) IN #UAE #Abortion Pills Available In Dubai

There are two types of pills necessary to complete an early medical #Abortion which must be taken within 48 hours of each other; these pills are #Mifepristone and Misoprostol. The first pill is a #Mifepristone tablet, this blocks progesterone, a hormone that is needed for your pregnancy to continue. The #Mifepristone tablet is taken orally with a glass of water. We then advise that you wait for one to two days before taking the Misoprostol pills. 

After your 24-48-hour break, you will take 4 Misoprostol pills which will cause your body to expel the pregnancy from the womb. Our pack comes with an instruction leaflet, which provides you with full details on how and when to take the pills. The second pills start the contractions to expel the fetus from the womb; we suggest taking a painkiller 10 minutes before.

Using #Mifepristone kit is best on pregnancies that are above 12 weeks. #Mifepristone, also known as RU-486 is a medication typically used in combination with misoprostol to bring about an #Abortion during pregnancy. It is also effective during the second trimester of pregnancy. Effectiveness should be verified in 2 weeks after use. 

#Mifepristone is an anti progestogen; it works by blocking the effect of progesterone, making the cervix easier to open and promoting contraction of the uterus when exposed to misoprostol. #Mifepristone (mife-kit) is used in combination with misoprostol (#cytotec) in order to perform a medicated #Abortion. You will take 2 sets of pills for your #Abortion to be effective.

The pill you will take on day 1 is #Mifepristone. #Mifepristone is taken through the mouth by swallowing like any normal pills. After swallowing the one #Mifepristone pill, wait for 24 hours before you use the other set of pills misoprostol, usually four pills. Put the 4 misoprostol pills under your tongue and wait till they dissolve before you swallow. #Abortion Pills Available In Dubai.
